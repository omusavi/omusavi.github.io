<h2 id="Giving-Back"><a href="#Giving-Back" class="headerlink" title="Giving Back"></a>Giving Back</h2><p>Since 2010, I have been proud to support the Makuyu Education Initiative.</p>
<p>Makuyu Education Initiative is a children’s home for approximately 16 children in grades 1 - 4. All the children come from extremely impoverished backgrounds. Some have escaped from Al-Shabab militias near the border with Somalia. Others have lost parents due to the HIV epidemic or because their parents abandoned them. The children’s home provides the children with an opportunity to escape the poverty that they were born into by giving them a safe place to sleep, nutritious meals, access to medical care, access to a quality education, and, perhaps most importantly, a loving family.</p>

<p>All of the funds we collect go directly to Kenya to help the children and we are 501(c)(3) certified. For more information, please visit <a href="http://www.moco2makuyu.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">their website</a> or visit their <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Makuyu-Education-Initiative-252603888102613/?fref=ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Facebook page</a> and consider donating!</p>
